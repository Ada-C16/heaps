Question | Answer
:------------- | :-------------
How is a Heap different from a Binary Search Tree? | Heaps are unordered
Could you build a heap with linked nodes? | No
Why is adding a node to a heap an O(log n) operation? | Because you only need to iterate half of the tree
Were the `heap_up` & `heap_down` methods useful?  Why? | Yes. heap_up checks if a node needs to move up and swap when necessary. heap_down removes a node at the root and replace the respective child upward.
